### JavaScript

JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled programming language.

Here is a description of this language from wikipedia on [JavaScript](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/JavaScript): 

> Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
>  JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
> The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
